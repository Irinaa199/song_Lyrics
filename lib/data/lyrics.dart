Mary had a little lamb
Little lamb, little lamb
Mary had a little lamb
Its fleece was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went
Mary went, Mary went
Everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go

const fiveLttleFingers='''
I came home last night to a dark and lonely cottage
I took the wreath off the door and somehow I stumbled inside
I just can't I just can't I said live without her
Give me one reason to live now that my darling has died
And then five little fingers touched my hand
Five little fingers too young to understand
And there was a softness in my little girl's touch
That seemed to say daddy I need you so
And in five little seconds her five little fingers told me all that I wanted to know
I could tell her little eyes were full of questions
I tried to answer but all I could do was hold her tight
Forgive me forgive me I said for crying

const thisLittlePig='''This little piggy went to market,
This little piggy stayed at home,
This little piggy had roast beef,
This little piggy had none.
And this little piggy went...
"Wee wee wee" all the way home...

const rowRowRowBoat='''
Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream
Merrily merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream
Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream
Merrily merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream

Baa, baa, black sheep, have you any wool?
Yes, sir, yes, sir, three bags full
One for my master, one for my dame
And one for the little boy who lives down the lane
